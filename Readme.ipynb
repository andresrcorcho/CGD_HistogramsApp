    "The HistogramApp is a Python 3.6 installable application (Windows, Mac) that enables earth scientists and students to easily generate KDE and PDP plots from geochronological data. This application allows the interactive customization of plot parameters such as bandwidth, the plotting interval (in Ma), numbers of ticks, fontsize, number of histogram bins, and implements an algorithm for automated detection of peaks (https://gist.github.com/antiface/7177333). In addition, it enables the user to easily design the output plot layout and to compare multiple datasets by stacking them in a single publication quality plot. HistogramsApp is able to handle the processing of multiple datasets, which might contain more than 100.000 individual records. Therefore, the HistogramsApp enables the processing of large and regional or continental scale datasets that are relevant for understanding regional provenance, plate evolution and orogenic cycles, and the evolution of the continental crust through time. Output figures are exported in both .PNG and .PDF file formats. PFDs generated by the HistogramsApp are vectorized, therefore, can be further edited in software as Illustrator, InkScape, etc. "
